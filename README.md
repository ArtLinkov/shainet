## Development

- [ ] Add multi-channel filtration, cut the string into multiple "segments" and let each channel process different ones.  
- [ ] Add back-prop\r-prop.  
- [ ] Add needed activation functions.  
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network  
- [ ] Build diverse and relevant tests to check Neural Net capabilities.  
- [ ] Bind and use CUDA  
- [ ] Research compression-on-the-fly as a mean to minimize the size of the payload sample.
